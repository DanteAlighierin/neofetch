# neofetch

I made this because I got a laptop from my school which runs macOS but my IT admin has blocked me from using the brew command. I wanted to install neofetch but since I couldn't use brew I decided to write neofetch my self in Python as a fun project and because I thought it would be a nice project and I wanted neofetch on my laptop.

## Installation
```$ pip install git+https://github.com/sdushantha/neofetch.git```

Now enjoy!
