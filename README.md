# neofetch

I made this because I have a school laptop running macOS and my IT admins have disabled me from being a super user. So I wanted to install the neofetch command on my laptop but since I could not do that, I decided to make my own.

## Steps to install neofetch
1. ```git clone https://github.com/sdushantha/neofetch.git```
2. Open Terminal
3. ```mkdir bin```
4. Move the neofetch (**not** neofetch.py) file into the bin file that was just created
5. ```chmod +x neofetch```
6. Now enjoy!
