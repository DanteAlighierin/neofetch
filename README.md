# neofetch

I made this because I got a laptop from my school which runs macOS but my IT admin has blocked me from using the brew command. I wanted to install neofetch but since I couldn't use brew I decided to write neofetch my self in Python as fun project because I thought it would be a nice project and I wanted neofetch on my laptop.

## Installation
```$ git clone https://github.com/sdushantha/neofetch.git```

## Setup
1. Make a bin directory under your home directory
2. Add ```export PATH=$PATH":$HOME/bin"``` to the  ```.profile``` or  ```.bash_profile``` file
3. Move the ```neofetch``` (**not** neofetch.py) file to the ```bin/``` directory that was just created
4. ```$ cd bin/```
5. ```$ chmod +x neofetch```
6. Now enjoy!
