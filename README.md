# neofetch

I made this because I have a school laptop running macOS and my IT admins have disabled me from being a super user. So I wanted to install the neofetch command on my laptop but since I could not do that, I decided to make my own

## Installation
```$ git clone https://github.com/sdushantha/neofetch.git```

## Setup
1. Make a bin directory under your home directory
2. Add ```export PATH=$PATH":$HOME/bin"``` to the  ```.profile``` or  ```.bash_profile``` file
3. Move the ```neofetch``` (**not** neofetch.py) file to the ```bin/``` directory that was just created
4. ```$ cd bin/```
5. ```$ chmod +x neofetch```
6. Now enjoy!
